# Power-BI

Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool that enables us to visualize and analyze data in a simple and interactive way. Learning how to use Power BI can be immensely useful for data analysis purposes, as it allows us to easily transform raw data into meaningful insights that can be used to make informed business decisions. 

## First Project:

[Analysing a dataset consisting of a survey about data professions](https://github.com/Aff1nity/Power-BI/tree/main/Data%20Professions%20Analysis)

The dataset contains information about survey takers including their unique ID, email, date and time taken, browser and operating system, city, country, referrer, time spent, job title, whether they switched careers into data, current yearly salary, industry, favorite programming language, and their level of happiness with various aspects of their job. It also includes information about the difficulty of breaking into data, the most important thing if they were to look for a new job, their gender, age, country of residence, highest level of education, and ethnicity. This dataset can be used for various data analysis purposes, such as identifying trends and patterns in job titles, industries, programming languages, and levels of happiness with different aspects of the job.
